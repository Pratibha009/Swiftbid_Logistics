        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p class="about1"> Imagine a bustling online marketplace where salespeople compete in a thrilling reverse
                auction. Welcome to SwiftBid Logistics, where the game is all about bidding lower than the set price. The salesperson who offers
                the lowest bid wins the auction and earns the right to pick up the product. Itâ€™s a dynamic and strategic
                platform where the lowest bid takes the prize!</p>

            <p class="about2">SwiftBid Logistics operates a unique auction platform where salespeople compete to bid the
                lowest amount for
                a product, and the lowest bidder wins the auction and gets to pick up the product. This type of auction is
                often referred to as a reverse auction.</p>

            <p class="about3"> In a reverse auction, the roles of buyer and seller are reversed compared to a traditional auction. Instead
                of buyers bidding higher amounts to win an item, sellers bid lower amounts to win the opportunity to sell
                their product or service. This can be particularly useful for businesses looking to minimize costs.</p>
